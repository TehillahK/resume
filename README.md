# How to write a resume in Markdown
## Introduction
Welcome to the exciting world of markdown . My task with this readMe is to hopefully teach you how to write your resume in markdown .You might be wondering why you need to write your resume in markdown and host it on a website . It helps show your technical prowess with newer web technologies and also details on your work experience and skill set as a developer.

## Why you need to Host the Resume
As physical media is growing outdated as time passes ,so are digital files like PDF and word documents. This files tend to sit on harddrives for years and risk getting corrupted ,deleted or simply to outdated for use. Hosting files online through a website elimates the possibility because its in a place where you can not lose it and could easily be produced upon request .

## Prerequisites 
1. Learn the Markdown syntax
  - What you Markdown is (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)
  - How to write in Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
2. Install a Markdown editor. I strongly recommend VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) but here is a list of other options you might like https://www.oberlo.ca/blog/markdown-editors .These editors will you run the program locally
3. A github account and familiarity with github web.


## The purpose of using GitHub Pages
Github is a collaborative site which is mostly used for software development . No one knows everything and about a programming or even a markup language like Markdown or the complexities of Jekyll . Jekyll will be used to style the websites and give it themes and change how it the Markdown file is presented on screen.This is similar to CSS in the case of HTML files . This hopefully will increase the quality of your resume and other projects you might use github or github pages for.
