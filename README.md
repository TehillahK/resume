# How to write a resume in Markdown
## Introduction
Welcome to the exciting world of markdown . My task with this readMe is to hopefully teach you how to write your resume in markdown .You might be wondering why you need to write your resume in markdown and host it on a website . It helps show your technical prowess with newer web technologies and also details on your work experience and skill set as a developer. Our choice to use Markdown instead of other markup languages is based on it being fairly light weight and in my opinion easy to pick up

## Why you need to Host the Resume
As physical media is growing outdated as time passes ,so are digital files like PDF and word documents. This files tend to sit on harddrives for years and risk getting corrupted ,deleted or simply to outdated for use. Hosting files online through a website elimates the possibility because its in a place where you can not lose it and could easily be produced upon request .

## Prerequisites 
1. Learn the Markdown syntax
  - What Markdown is (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)
  - How to write in Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
2. Install a Markdown editor. I strongly recommend VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) but here is a list of other options you might like https://www.oberlo.ca/blog/markdown-editors .These editors will you run the program locally
3. A github account and familiarity with github web.


## The purpose of using GitHub Pages
Github is a collaborative site which is mostly used for software development . No one knows everything and about a programming or even a markup language like Markdown or the complexities of Jekyll . Jekyll will be used to style the websites and give it themes and change how it the Markdown file is presented on screen.This is similar to CSS in the case of HTML files . This hopefully will increase the quality of your resume and other projects you might use github or github pages for.

## How we do it?
### 1. Create an index.md file 
Use an editor of your choice for this but for the purposes of this read me I will assume you are using VSCode to build your resume.
### 2. Create a public github repository

 Create a public github repo in the format of your userName@github.io .Look at the image above for reference.In order for the github pages to integrate the site.
 
 ### 3. Upload the index.md file

Like in the picture above click on add file and upload your index file.
 
  ### 4. Activate your github pages

  Click on Settings and scroll down to the section that says Github pages and under source click on the dropdown that says none and select your main branch.The advantage of this is that it will generate a static site for you which is much simpler than making a static site the traditional way. Its easy to update the information of your site because you only have to edit the markdown .
  
  ### 5.Styling your website
  After confirming the site has been created ,it is time to give it a little visual flare with the themes github provides on their platform. 
  	
	1. Click on settings 
	2. Screw down to the github pages section
	3. Under theme choose .Click on change theme and pick a theme you feel is most appropriate. 
	I personally suggest "The Matrix" theme which is called "hack" because you can not go wrong 
	with a matrix reference
